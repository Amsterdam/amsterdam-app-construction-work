    Vincenty's formulae are two related iterative methods used in geodesy to calculate the distance between two
    points on the surface of a spheroid, developed by Thaddeus Vincenty (1975a). They are based on the assumption
    that the figure of the Earth is an oblate spheroid, and hence are more accurate than methods that assume a
    spherical Earth, such as great-circle distance.

    The most accurate and widely used globally-applicable model for the earth ellipsoid is WGS-84, used in this
    script. Other ellipsoids offering a better fit to the local geoid include Airy (1830) in the UK, International
    1924 in much of Europe, Clarke (1880) in Africa, and GRS-67 in South America. America (NAD83) and Australia
    (GDA) use GRS-80, functionally equivalent to the WGS-84 ellipsoid.

    Latitude must be in the [-90; 90] range.
    Longitude must be in the [-180; 180] range.

    Strides:

    An average man's stride length is 78 centimeters, while a woman's average stride length is 70 centimeters. In
    To compute the distance in steps this class uses the average length of 0.74 meter
