""" Free-text search within TEXT or CHAR fields of any given model. At least three characters are required for this
    class to start searching. Each next query field counts for half the weight in the result score. Only results
    where the search query is found as-is (adjacent) are returned. The results are returned in descending score as
    a paginated result.

    For this class to function your database is required to support the extension 'pg_trgm' (TrigramWordSimilarity)
    and 'unaccent' (search agnostic for accents e.g. Ã¼ or u are equivalent)

    query: string
    query_fields: comma separated string of model fields
