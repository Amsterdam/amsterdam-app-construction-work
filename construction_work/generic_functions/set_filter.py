""" SetFilter is used as a single way to set DB filtering based on kwargs. It saves a lot of duplicate and
    cluttering code from the views_*_.py where we'd like to return DB results based on set query parameters.

    If the value of a keyword is None, it will be omitted from the filter.

    e.g.:

    {'a': None, 'b': 1} will become {'b': 1}
