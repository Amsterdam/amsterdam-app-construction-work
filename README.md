# Technical Architecture


#### Application overview
The Construction-Work application boasts a robust technical architecture to efficiently manage and disseminate information about construction projects in Amsterdam. Key technologies used include Python and the Django framework for the backend, and Vue.js for the frontend. Let's delve deeper into the various components:

#### Backend frameworks
The backend of the Construction-Work application is built using Python, a versatile programming language, and Django, a powerful web framework. Django provides a standardized structure for developing web applications, including built-in security layers, ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), and an easy way to define API endpoints. This forms the foundation for data processing and application logic.

#### Database
The application employs a relational database, such as PostgreSQL, to store data related to construction projects. Django's ORM allows developers to interact efficiently with the database, simplifying project data management.

#### APIs
The backend offers a set of RESTful APIs that supply the Amsterdam-App with relevant information. These APIs serve as the bridge between the database and the application's frontend. They enable the frontend to fetch data, update project-information, and post messages.

#### Frontend (Vue.js)
The Construction-Work application's frontend is developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. Vue.js enables the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The frontend is responsible for displaying project-information, managing user-profiles, and presenting notifications to users.

#### MBS
The environment manager module (mbs) is a crucial part of the application. Here, authorized users such as environment managers can input and update specific information about construction projects. This includes posting messages, tracking project status changes, and sharing updates with the community.

#### Notifications
The push notification system is integrated into the Amsterdam-App and utilizes mobile platform notification services (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging for Android). Users can opt to receive push notifications when there are updates for the projects they are following.

#### Moderator interface
The moderation interface is developed using Vue.js and provides administrators with the ability to view, approve, or moderate messages posted by environment managers. This ensures that the shared information remains accurate and relevant to the Amsterdam community.

### Data Flow

The data flow within the Construction-Work application starts with IPROX, Amsterdam's content management system, where data about construction projects is collected and stored. This data is retrieved via APIs and loaded into the application's backend. Environment managers can post messages and update project information through the environment manager module, which is then displayed in the Amsterdam-App. Users can choose to receive push notifications on their mobile devices when there are updates.

#### Summary
In summary, the Construction-Work application is an advanced technological system that streamlines communication and information sharing regarding construction projects in Amsterdam. It leverages modern web technologies and frameworks to provide a seamless experience for both project managers and the Amsterdam community. The Vue.js interface, in this case, is specifically designed for creating environment manager accounts and moderating their messages.


# Pre-requisites

Make sure your docker environment is up and running and you have a recent version of docker-compose installed.

### API documentation

If the backend is running, you can visit the online api documentation

```
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/apidocs
```

The definition for the api documentation are in the file 'views_swagger_auto_schema.py'

### Developer documentation:
README-development.md Here you can find among other settings e.g. how to enable debug mode.

### Setup your database credentials
```
    run: chmod +x set_env.py && ./set_env.py
```

**Example output:**

```
    Please enter your POSTGRES database (default: amsterdam_app_backend): 
    Please enter your POSTGRES username (default: backend): 
    Please enter your POSTGRES password (or use: 94ADsLnM): 
    Save values to environment? (Y/N/A(bort)): N
    Please enter your POSTGRES database (default: amsterdam_app_backend): 
    Please enter your POSTGRES username (default: backend): 
    Please enter your POSTGRES password (or use: flr5fbjH): MyS3cr3t                
    Save values to environment? (Y/N/A(bort)): y
```

**Your environment will look like:**

```
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=MyS3cr3t
    POSTGRES_USER=backend
    POSTGRES_DB=amsterdam_app_backend
```

## Build and start the Amsterdam-App-Backend

```
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file ./env up --build --remove-orphans
```

**Note**:

The docker must run **sudo** because the database files are unreadable for normal users. This will prevent the build step
from succeeding and hence the docker containers won't start.

**Example output**:

```
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file ./env up --build --remove-orphans
    Docker Compose is now in the Docker CLI, try `docker compose up`

### Database 

The Amsterdam-App-Backend will make use of the postgres database server. Use setenv.sh script for setting your 
credentials. Database files will be stored in '/data/db' folder in your project root.

### Get initial data

Make sure your application is running on port 8000 on your localhost. Now open the url below in your
browser of choice to fetch initial data or update existing data. This end-point will disappear in the
near future in favour of a cron-job. 

```
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/projects/ingest
    Valid (mandatory) query parameter: project-type=['brug', 'kade']
```

### API documentation

There is online API documentation available at:
```
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/apidocs
```

There is offline documentation available at:
```
    /amsterdam_app_api/swagger_views_*.py
```

### Garbage collector

When a content item was seen before but not in the last Iprox scrape, the content item will be marked inactive. 
If the content item has been marked inactive for over 1 week, the content item and its siblings will be removed.

    Siblings are: Warning-messages, News items, Project, Project details, subscriptions for phones, authorizations for project-managers and so forth.
